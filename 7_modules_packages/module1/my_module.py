#   PyPi is a repository for open-source third-party Python packages.  
#   We can use `pip install` for installing packages.
#   
#   To create own modules.
#   ------------------------------
#   
#   There is a script file __init__.py makes Python treat entire scripts within that folder to consider as a package
#   All that module is it's just the .py script being called from another py script. 
#
